The National Pension System (NPS) is fast emerging as a popular retirement planning tool for salaried professionals across India, including those in the fast-paced and financially rewarding IT sector. With structured long-term savings, tax advantages, and the power of compounding, NPS offers unique benefits—but also some limitations—that IT professionals should consider carefully.

Stable retirement planning in a volatile industry The IT industry, known for high salaries and frequent job changes, offers limited long-term financial security unless professionals actively plan their retirement. While Employee Provident Fund (EPF) remains a standard benefit for most salaried individuals, NPS can complement EPF by offering additional savings with potentially higher market-linked returns and greater flexibility in choosing asset classes like equity and corporate bonds.

Tax benefits make NPS highly attractive NPS stands out as one of the most tax-efficient investment options under the Income Tax Act. IT professionals can claim tax deductions under:

· Section 80CCD(1): Up to ₹1.5 lakh within the overall 80C limit.

· Section 80CCD(1B): An additional ₹50,000 deduction, exclusively for NPS contributions.

This ₹50,000 extra deduction is especially valuable for IT professionals who are already exhausting their 80C limit through EPF, life insurance premiums, or home loan principal repayments. For those in the 30% tax slab, this translates to a direct saving of ₹15,600 annually (including cess).

High growth potential with equity exposure NPS allows allocation of up to 75% in equity under its Active Choice option, a feature that appeals to younger IT professionals with long investment horizons and a higher risk appetite. This equity component is capped gradually as investors age, reducing risk closer to retirement. Given the historical outperformance of equities over other asset classes, NPS offers the potential to grow retirement savings more aggressively than traditional fixed-income options.

Cost-effective investment structure With fund management fees as low as 0.01%—one of the lowest globally—NPS is highly cost-efficient. IT professionals who are used to investing in mutual funds or ULIPs will find NPS offers a much cheaper route to similar market-linked returns. The low costs can make a significant difference over 20-30 years of compounding.

Portability suits job-hopping professionals Frequent job changes are common in the IT sector. Unlike EPF, which often needs to be transferred or merged with every switch, NPS is fully portable and independent of the employer. Contributions continue uninterrupted regardless of employment changes, making it especially suitable for IT freelancers, consultants, or those planning to move abroad while retaining Indian retirement accounts.

Limitations to consider Despite its strengths, NPS comes with some constraints:

· Limited liquidity: Partial withdrawals are allowed only after three years and only for specific reasons such as illness or education, and even then, up to a limit.

· Mandatory annuity purchase: At maturity (age 60), 40% of the corpus must be used to buy an annuity, which may offer relatively low returns compared to lump sum investments.

· Tax on annuity income: While 60% of the corpus is tax-free at withdrawal, annuity payments are taxable as income in the year received.

These factors may make NPS less appealing to those seeking full flexibility or planning early retirement before 60.

Ideal for disciplined long-term savers NPS works best for IT professionals who are looking for a disciplined, tax-efficient, and market-linked investment to supplement other retirement savings. It encourages staying invested over decades, which aligns well with wealth accumulation goals for the long term.

Conclusion: a smart choice with the right mindset For IT professionals who are already maxing out their EPF and 80C benefits, and who are looking for an additional retirement-focused investment with tax savings and long-term market exposure, NPS is a worthy option. While it may not offer full liquidity or immediate returns, its structure is ideal for those who think ahead and value financial security in retirement.

Before investing, professionals should assess their retirement goals, risk appetite, and whether they’re comfortable with locking in funds for the long term. For those who are, NPS could be a solid pillar in their financial foundation.
Should you break your fixed deposit or take a loan against it? Here's how to decide--12993460
Deciding between breaking a fixed deposit or taking a loan against it depends on urgency, penalty costs, repayment ability, and the long-term impact on your financial goals.

Fixed deposits (FDs) are among the most popular investment instruments for Indians looking for assured returns with minimal risk. However, life is unpredictable, and situations arise where you might need to access funds locked in your FD. When that happens, you’re typically faced with two choices: prematurely break the FD or take a loan against it. Both options serve the purpose of liquidity but come with very different financial implications.

What happens when you withdraw your FD early?

Breaking your FD before maturity is simple but comes at a cost. Banks generally levy a premature withdrawal penalty of 0.5% to 1% on the interest rate that was initially agreed upon. Moreover, you may not get the contracted rate at all — the interest may be recalculated at the rate applicable for the period you actually held the FD. For example, if you booked a 5-year FD at 7.5% but withdrew it after 2 years, the bank might give you only 6% (the 2-year rate) minus penalty. That’s a significant loss, especially for large deposits.

Additionally, breaking your FD resets your savings journey. If your FD was meant for a long-term goal — such as a child’s education or retirement — accessing it early could disrupt your financial planning and reduce the compounding benefit over time.

Why a loan against FD could be a better choice

Taking a loan against your FD allows you to meet urgent financial needs without touching the principal investment. Most banks allow you to borrow up to 90% of the FD amount at an interest rate only 1% to 2% higher than the FD’s return. For instance, if your FD earns 7%, your loan rate might be 8%–9%. This is significantly cheaper than personal loans or credit cards, where interest rates can go up to 18%–24%.

What’s more, the FD continues to earn interest throughout the loan tenure. This means your overall wealth isn’t eroded, and you get to retain the maturity benefit. Also, since this is a secured loan, the documentation process is minimal — there’s no need for income proof or credit score checks.

Banks usually offer such loans in the form of an overdraft or term loan. An overdraft offers flexibility, allowing you to withdraw as needed and pay interest only on the amount used. This can be ideal for short-term or uncertain expenses.

Evaluate based on financial urgency and repayment capacity

If your financial requirement is short-term and you have a repayment plan in place, a loan against FD is almost always the smarter option. It ensures your investment stays intact, your credit score remains unaffected, and you save on premature withdrawal penalties.

However, if you’re unsure about repayment or are dealing with a long-term crisis — such as job loss or medical emergencies — withdrawing the FD may be more practical. That way, you don’t risk defaulting on a loan or paying additional interest. It’s also worth breaking the FD if the remaining term is very short or if interest rates have dropped significantly since you booked the deposit and reinvestment won’t yield much.

Tax implications matter too

Another aspect to consider is the tax treatment. Interest earned on FDs is taxable as per your income slab, whether you break it or take a loan against it. However, premature withdrawal doesn’t give you any tax benefit, while loan repayment doesn’t add to your tax burden either. You’re just paying a small extra amount to preserve your investment — and that can be a better deal in the long run.

When you should definitely avoid premature FD withdrawal

Avoid breaking your FD if you are in a high-interest rate regime and the FD was booked at a much better rate than current offerings. In such cases, losing that high-yield instrument may hurt your portfolio. It’s also unwise to break your FD if the penalty is steep or if you're close to maturity — waiting a little longer could save a substantial sum.

The bottom line

Breaking your fixed deposit should be a last resort. In most situations, a loan against FD gives you access to immediate funds at a low cost while allowing your money to continue earning interest. It's a smart liquidity solution that protects your financial goals. However, if repayment is a concern or the penalty is negligible, a premature withdrawal might still be the better path. The key is to assess your situation calmly and choose what supports your long-term financial health.
